# Contributing to Decentralized Network

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for new components
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Commit Messages
